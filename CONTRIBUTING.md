# Contributing to Belfast

Thank you very much for considering contributing to Belfast!

I'm going to assume you have an idea of what you want to do, and you're looking to please me with your contribution.

1. Code style is not really important, as long as your code is readable & you use `gofmt`.
2. That's it! Test your code with the game, write unit tests if you can & want to, then submit a pull request!

Any contribution is welcome, whatever it may be.

For any inquiries, feel free to contact me at at [molly@mana.rip](mailto:molly@mana.rip) or on Discord: `ggmolly`.
